# ada-router
This is an ADA project designed to act as a router with a cache. The data structure used is a linked list of associative data. 
Another part of the project that was not completed is the representation of the cache as a prefix cache. 
We implemented many command line options for the operation of this program.
You can find a lot of documentations in french that me and [Mathieu](https://github.com/mathieuzeidler) realized inside this repo. 
This project was realized during my engineering studies in Digital Sciences at ENSEEIHT.
